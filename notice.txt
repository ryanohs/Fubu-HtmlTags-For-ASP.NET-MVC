This is a Derivative Work of the original HtmlTags and "reboot" FubuMVC.UI projects available from

http://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc


I have included the compiled HtmlTags assembly and copied all necessary classes/files from FubuMVC.UI and FubuMVC.Core to get this adapter to compile against Microsoft MVC 1.0. Directory structures have mostly been left in tact and namespaces are the original.

The sample web application is original work available under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
